# Editing Story JavaScript and CSS

Twine allows you to add both JavaScript and CSS (short for Cascading
Stylesheets) to your stories. This code allows you to customize the behavior and
appearance of your story when it's played, but the exact details of how to do
this depend on which story format you're using. You should read your story
format's documentation for more information on how this works.

JS and CSS are both web standards, and accordingly there are many online
resources that can teach you how to use them. The Mozilla Developer Network, for
example, has [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) and
[JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) learning areas
which contain gentle tutorials on both these technologies.

To edit a story's CSS, choose _Stylesheet_ from the _Story_ top toolbar tab. To
edit a story's JavaScript, choose _JavaScript_ from the _Story_ top toolbar tab.
Like passage edit dialogs, these dialogs automatically save changes a moment
after you stop typing.
