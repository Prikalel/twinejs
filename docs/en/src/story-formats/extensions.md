# Disabling Story Format Extensions

Story formats can extend Twine by adding:

- References between passages, which appear as dotted lines connecting passages
  in the Story Map screen
- A toolbar in passage edit dialogs
- Syntax coloring in passage edit dialogs

If these extensions are buggy or you just prefer not to use them, you can
disable them. Select the story format card in the Story Format screen and choose
_Disable Editor Extensions_ from the _Story Format_ top toolbar tab. To reverse
this change, select the same card and choose _Enable Editor Extensions_ from the
_Story Format_ top toolbar tab.

Disabling extensions disables all extensions for a format. You can't disable
just the toolbar, for example, but not a format's references or syntax coloring.
